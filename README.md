## 🛡️ Security & Antivirus Notice

Because DropLaunch is a self-contained `.exe` with embedded dependencies, some antivirus tools (like Microsoft Defender) may trigger a **cloud security scan** or SmartScreen warning — especially on first launch.

### ✅ This is expected behavior for unsigned apps.

We’ve submitted DropLaunch for review via the Microsoft Defender portal to improve early trust. As expected it was deemed safe. 
The tool:
- **Runs entirely offline** after setup  
- **Does not transmit data** or collect telemetry  
- **Includes no ads or bundled installers**

If you encounter SmartScreen, click **"More Info > Run Anyway"** (after verifying the source).
